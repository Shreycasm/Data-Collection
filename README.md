#Men's T-Shirt Data Collection
This project focuses on collecting data from various men's t-shirt websites. The data was gathered using a combination of web scraping techniques and API endpoints. The collected data has been processed and stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

###Data Collection Process
Web Scraping: I used web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from the product pages of multiple men's t-shirt websites. This involved parsing HTML content, navigating through pages, and handling dynamic content.

API Endpoints: Where available, I utilized API endpoints to directly fetch product data, which allowed for a more structured and efficient data collection process.

###Output
The collected data, including product details like names, prices, descriptions, and availability status, has been consolidated into a CSV file.
